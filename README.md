PRODIGY INFOTECH DATASCIENCE INTERNSHIP -TASK 05

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 5 repository! 

TASK OUTLINE

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

KNOWLEDGE ACQUIRED

I undertook a comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data to identify patterns linked to road conditions, weather, and the time of day. This involved visualizing accident hotspots and determining contributing factors. My responsibilities included data preprocessing and cleaning, as well as exploratory data analysis. To address class imbalance, I applied oversampling methods. Finally, I utilized the KNN Classifier to fit and predict the model, aiming to enhance the accuracy of traffic accident predictions.
